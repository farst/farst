### Hi. I'm Farshad

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Bayer CropSciences](https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/),
where I help with data and analytics on the edge of IoT in glass-house technology.  I also design data solutions that falls under the automated decision-making (ADM) umbrella.

In 2018 I joined a group of transdisciplinary scientists at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/),
which led into collaboration with a bigger network of artists and scientists at [SEADS](https://seads.network/).

Checkout the Evolutionary Asteroid Starship model at [EAS](https://github.com/farst/EAS) repository. It is a DES model fully scripted in [R](https://www.r-project.org) using [Simmer](https://r-simmer.org) in collaboration with Delft University of Technology and SEADS.
